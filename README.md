Project Brief	        "Make a ""Number Guessing App"":Point
                        - There are 02 roles: Player, and House(PC)
                        - There is a deck, contains 52 playing cards. There are:
                            + 4 Suites: Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade
                            + 13 groups: A(Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J(Jack), Q(Queen), K(King)
                            + 02 greatest cards: Black Joker, Red Joker
                        - Each round, the Player and the House receive 01 card from the deck.
                        - Player has to guess that his card is greater or less than the House's card.
                        - Player starts with 60 points.
                        - Reward for each winning round is 20 points.
                        - Player must pay 25 points to join a single match
                        - Game stages:
                            + The House receives and shows his card first.
                            + Player start guessing.
                            + If the Player loses the round, he'll lose the reward.
                            + If the Player wins the round, he can decide to continue or stop.
                            + If the Player decides to stop, he can keep his current reward.
                            + If the Player decides to continue, He does not receive the reward yet. But the reward will be doubled on the next round.
                        - Game Win/Lose conditions:
                            + Player will WIN the game if he has greater than or equal to 1000 points after any match.
                            + Player will LOSE the game if he has less than 30 points after any match."
